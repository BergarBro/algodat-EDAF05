  \section{Results}

  \todo[inline]{Briefly comment the results, did the script say all your solutions were correct? Approximately how long time does it take for the program to run on the largest input? What takes the majority of the time?}
    % Yes, all cases was correct
    % The lagest case to aprox 2,5 minutes and most of the time was spent BFS the graph. A lot of BFS hade to be made.
    %

  \section{Implementation details}

  \todo[inline]{How did you implement the solution? Which data structures were used? Which modifications to these data structures were used? What is the overall running time? Why?}
    % I used Edge and Node object, that I wrote. Then vectors to stor the in, pairs to be able to store two diffrent indexis in the same vector. 
    % Total runtime was 3,5 min for the whole test, large was the biggest time-sink.
